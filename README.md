# Protein Explorer

## Overview
Protein Explorer is a Python-based tool that allows users to visualize protein structures using **Py3Dmol**. It provides information about proteins, including their PDB IDs, functions, and structure visualizations, making it a valuable resource for researchers, students, and bioinformatics enthusiasts.

## Features
- Display detailed information about proteins, including their name, function, and PDB ID.
- Visualize protein structures using **Py3Dmol**.
- Interactive and user-friendly interface.
- Easily extendable to support more proteins.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:

```bash
pip install py3Dmol
```

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/protein-explorer.git
   cd protein-explorer
   ```
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python protein_explorer.py
   ```
3. If using Jupyter Notebook, import the script and call the main function:
   ```python
   from protein_explorer import display_protein_info
   display_protein_info()
   ```

## Example Output
Upon running the script, the program will display information about proteins and visualize their structures interactively using Py3Dmol.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a **search functionality** to look up proteins by name or PDB ID.
- Implement a **GUI interface** for better user experience.
- Integrate **external APIs** to fetch real-time protein data.
